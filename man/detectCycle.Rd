\title{detectCycle
Detects breathing cycles (negative peaks with smoothing methods). A breaking cycle begins half of an inspiration, then a full expiration, then an last half of inspiration}
\usage{
detectCycle(
  df,
  minExpi = NULL,
  maxInspi = NULL,
  smoothMethod = "MovingAverage",
  method = "MAD",
  halfWindowSize = 5,
  maximum = NULL,
  SNR = 0,
  minimalDuration = 2,
  forMinExpiDivideMaxIntBy = 4,
  forMaxInspiDivideMaxIntBy = 5,
  mobileMinExpi = NULL,
  mobileMaxInspi = NULL,
  mobileK = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{dataframe with two columns whose colnames are 'intensity','time'}

\item{minExpi}{minimal value for an expiry intensity to be detected as an expiry (blue dotted line in the plot).}

\item{maxInspi}{maximal intensity of the original curve required to be considered as a breathing peak (purple dotted line in the plot)}

\item{smoothMethod}{smoothing method. Among "MovingAverage" or "SavitzkyGolay". See MSnbase::smooth for more details.}

\item{method}{method to estimate the noise "MAD" or ""}

\item{halfWindowSize}{required for the smoothing method. Integer corresponding to the half window size to consider.}

\item{maximum}{last value to attribue to the breathing cycle (end of tasting for example)}

\item{SNR}{signal noise ratio (0 by default) required to be considered as a peak}

\item{minimalDuration}{minimalDuration of a breathing cycle (2 by default - as a accelerated breathing frequency corresponds to 20 cycles and more by minut and a low frequency is 12 and less -)}

\item{forMinExpiDivideMaxIntBy}{default to 5. When minExpi is null, it is evaluated as the ratio of the maximal intensity and forMinIntensityDivideMaxIntBy}

\item{forMaxInspiDivideMaxIntBy}{default to 5. When minExpi is null, it is evaluated as the ratio of the maximal intensity and forMinIntensityDivideMaxIntBy}

\item{mobileMinExpi}{a integer higher than 3. If not NULL, the minimal intensity required for an expiration is a mobile one, defined by an mobile average (on the number of points defined in mobileMinExpi) + mobileStd * mobile standard deviations (on the same number of points)}

\item{mobileMaxInspi}{a integer higher than 3. If not NULL, the maximal intensity required for an inspiration is a mobile one, defined by an mobile average (on the number of points defined in mobileMinExpi) - mobileK * mobile standard deviations (on the same number of points)}

\item{mobileK}{default to 2. a number to be used in mobileMinExpi or mobileMaxInspi if not NULL}
