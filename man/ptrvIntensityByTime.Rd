\arguments{
\item{dataset}{whose names are timeCol, Ion1,... ,Ionp.}

\item{timeCol}{name of the column of dataset containing the time}

\item{colToRemove}{vector containing the names of the columns of datasets to be removed in the analysis (column that are neither the time nor ions names)}

\item{correction}{"none" or "cycle". See Details.}

\item{referenceBreath}{name of the ion taken as reference for breathing}

\item{timePeriod}{vector containing starting and stopping point to get the statistics}

\item{ions}{vector contatining all ions to be used in the analysis (by default all ions are used)}

\item{funAggregate}{"mean", "maximal" or "sum"}

\item{total}{if TRUE, the total intensity is calculated and added as a supplementary column}

\item{breathRatio}{if TRUE, the ratio between the intensity of ion and the breath is calculated}

\item{minExpi}{minimal value for an expiry intensity to be detected as an expiry (blue dotted line in the plot).}

\item{maxInspi}{maximal intensity of the original curve required to be considered as a breathing peak (purple dotted line in the plot)}

\item{minimalDuration}{minimalDuration of a breathing cycle (2 by default - as a accelerated breathing frequency corresponds to 20 cycles and more by minut and a low frequency is 12 and less -)}

\item{forMinExpiDivideMaxIntBy}{default to 5. When minExpi is null, it is evaluated as the ratio of the maximal intensity and forMinIntensityDivideMaxIntBy}

\item{forMaxInspiDivideMaxIntBy}{default to 5. When minExpi is null, it is evaluated as the ratio of the maximal intensity and forMinIntensityDivideMaxIntBy}

\item{halfWindowSize}{parameter used to determine the smooth for the peak-picking used in break detection}

\item{method}{method used for peak picking ("MAD" by default)}

\item{SNR}{Signal noise ratio parameter used in peak picking}

\item{timeStart}{timeStart is a value to be removed of the relTime column}

\item{removeNoise}{if TRUE, the averaged intensity obtained during the timeBlank period is removed from the signal}

\item{smoothMethod}{NULL, "SavitzkyGolay" or "MovingAverage"}
}
\value{
a list containing the obtained result (res), ggplot object containing different plots (gg) and, if correction='cycle' the cycle results are also added (detectCycle)
}
\description{
Calculates the intensity by time for PTRViewer files. The calculation can be done by breathing cycle or on raw data.Breathing cycles are calculated on a reference ion (referenceBreath) with peak picking algorithms
}
\details{
if 'cycle' is selected in correction option, the breathing cycles are calculated
