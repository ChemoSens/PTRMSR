}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{whose names are IN THIS ORDER:AbsTime, RelTime, Cycle, Ion1,... ,Ionp.}

\item{method}{"max" or "ttest" (TODO "tangente")}

\item{referenceBreath}{name of the ion taken as reference for breathing}

\item{noisePeriod}{vector with two numbers indicating the period corresponding to a blank period.}

\item{correction}{"none" or "cycle". See Details.}

\item{multiplyNoiseBy}{a number such as a ion whose maximal intensity during tasting/maximal intensity during blank period > multiplyNoiseBy is detected as significant (used for method=="max")}

\item{removeNoise}{if TRUE, the noise is removed in the calculation of intensity by time}

\item{maxPeaks}{A number. Below this value, a peak is not considered as a peak}
